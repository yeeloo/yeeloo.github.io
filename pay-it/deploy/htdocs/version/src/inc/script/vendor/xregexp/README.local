Description:
XRegExp provides augmented, extensible JavaScript regular expressions. You get
new syntax, flags, and methods beyond what browsers support natively. XRegExp is
also a regex utility belt with tools to make your client-side grepping simpler
and more powerful, while freeing you from worrying about pesky cross-browser
inconsistencies and the dubious `lastIndex` property.
