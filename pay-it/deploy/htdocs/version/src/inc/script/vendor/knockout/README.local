Description:
Knockout is a JavaScript MVVM (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it
easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML.
It uses observers to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying
data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of declarative bindings to
enable productive development.

Local Modifications:
Changed license header, wrapping in  /*!  */, to keep the license header in
build output.
