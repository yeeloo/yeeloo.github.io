Description:
PreloadJS is a library to make working with asset preloading easier. It provides
a consistent API for loading different file types, automatic detection of XHR
(XMLHttpRequest) availability with a fallback to tag-base loading, composite
progress events, and a plugin model to assist with preloading in other libraries
such as SoundJS.
